## üìñ How to Use

### Basic Controls

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **r** | Send Gratuitous ARP | Restores correct ARP mapping (defense) |
| **s** | Toggle Static ARP | Enable/disable static ARP entries (prevents updates) |
| **q** | Quit | Close the simulation |

### What You'll See

1. **Three Network Nodes**:
   - üîµ **Victim** (192.168.1.10) - The target host
   - üü¢ **Gateway** (192.168.1.1) - Legitimate router
   - üî¥ **Spoofer** (192.168.1.80) - Attacker performing ARP spoofing

2. **ARP Cache Display**: Shows the victim's current IP‚ÜíMAC mappings in real-time

3. **Event Log**: Console and on-screen log showing ARP requests, replies, and attacks

4. **Visual Traffic Flow**: Line connecting Victim to Gateway changes color based on ARP cache state

---

## üéì Demo Script (2-3 Minutes)

### Step 1: Initial State (0-3 seconds)
- **Observe**: Victim's ARP cache is empty
- **Flow**: Gray line (no connectivity)
- **Explain**: "Without ARP mapping, the victim can't communicate with the gateway"

### Step 2: Legitimate ARP Exchange (3-6 seconds)
- **Event**: Victim sends ARP Request for gateway IP
- **Response**: Gateway replies with correct MAC address
- **Result**: ARP cache populated, flow turns **green**
- **Explain**: "Normal ARP: Victim learns Gateway IP ‚Üí Gateway MAC"

### Step 3: ARP Spoofing Attack (6-10 seconds)
- **Event**: Spoofer sends forged ARP replies
- **Claim**: "Gateway IP is at Spoofer MAC" (fake!)
- **Result**: ARP cache updated, flow turns **red**
- **Explain**: "ARP poisoning: Victim now sends gateway traffic to attacker"

### Step 4: Defense Demonstration (Press 'r')
- **Action**: Send gratuitous ARP from gateway
- **Result**: Cache restored, flow returns to **green**
- **Explain**: "Gratuitous ARP repair: Gateway reasserts correct mapping"

### Step 5: Static ARP Defense (Press 's')
- **Action**: Enable static ARP entries
- **Result**: Victim node turns light green, ignores further poisoning
- **Explain**: "Static ARP: Mapping locked, immune to forged replies"

## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### How ARP Works (Normal Operation)

```
1. Victim needs to send IP packet to 192.168.1.1
2. Victim checks ARP cache: Empty!
3. Victim broadcasts: "Who has 192.168.1.1? Tell 192.168.1.10"
4. Gateway responds: "192.168.1.1 is at GG:GG:GG:GG:GG:01"
5. Victim caches: 192.168.1.1 ‚Üí GG:GG:GG:GG:GG:01
6. Victim sends Ethernet frame to Gateway's MAC
```

### How ARP Spoofing Works (Attack)

```
1. Spoofer monitors network traffic
2. Spoofer sends forged ARP reply to Victim:
   "192.168.1.1 is at SS:SS:SS:SS:SS:80" (LIE!)
3. Victim updates cache: 192.168.1.1 ‚Üí SS:SS:SS:SS:SS:80
4. Victim now sends Gateway-bound frames to Spoofer
5. Spoofer can intercept, modify, or drop packets (MITM)
```

### Why ARP is Vulnerable

- ‚ùå **No authentication**: ARP has no built-in security
- ‚ùå **Stateless protocol**: Hosts accept unsolicited ARP replies
- ‚ùå **Trust model**: Assumes all nodes on LAN are trustworthy
- ‚ùå **Broadcast nature**: All hosts can see ARP traffic

---

## üõ°Ô∏è Defense Mechanisms Explained

### 1. Gratuitous ARP (Reactive)
**What it is**: A host broadcasts ARP reply about its own IP address

**How to use in simulation**: Press **'r'** key

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Quick to restore correct mapping
- ‚úÖ No configuration required
- ‚úÖ Works immediately

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Temporary fix (attacker can re-poison)
- ‚ùå Reactive, not preventive
- ‚ùå Race condition with attacker

**Real-world use**: Network admins can send gratuitous ARP when detecting attacks

### 2. Static ARP Entries (Preventive)
**What it is**: Manually configuring IP‚ÜíMAC mappings that don't change

**How to use in simulation**: Press **'s'** key

**Pros**:
- ‚úÖ Immune to ARP poisoning
- ‚úÖ Persistent protection
- ‚úÖ No race conditions

**Cons**:
- ‚ùå Doesn't scale to large networks
- ‚ùå Manual maintenance required
- ‚ùå Breaks when hardware changes

**Real-world command**:
```bash
# Linux
arp -s 192.168.1.1 GG:GG:GG:GG:GG:01

# Windows
arp -s 192.168.1.1 GG-GG-GG-GG-GG-01
```

### 3. Production Defenses (Not in simulation, for reference)

#### Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
- Switch feature that validates ARP packets
- Checks against DHCP snooping database
- Drops invalid/suspicious ARP replies

#### Port Security
- Limits which MAC addresses can connect to switch ports
- Prevents unauthorized devices from spoofing

#### 802.1X Network Access Control
- Authentication before network access granted
- Ensures only authorized devices on network

if prev is not None and prev != mac:
    alert = f"‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: ARP mapping changed for {ip}"
    alert += f"\n  Old: {prev}\n  New: {mac}"
    log(alert)
```

#### 2. Export Log (5 minutes)
```python
# Add button handler
elif event.key == 'e':
    with open('arp_log.txt', 'w') as f:
        f.write('\n'.join(LOG_LINES))
    log("Exported log to arp_log.txt")
```

#### 3. Packet Counter (10 minutes)
```python
# Add global counters
legitimate_packets = 0
forged_packets = 0

# Update in send_arp_reply / send_forged_reply
# Display in matplotlib text box
```

## üéì For Instructors & Students

### Discussion Questions

1. **Protocol Design**: Why doesn't ARP include authentication? What would be the cost?

2. **Trust Models**: What assumptions does ARP make about network participants?

3. **Layer Interactions**: How does ARP bridge the network layer (IP) and data-link layer (MAC)?

4. **Security vs Usability**: Why aren't static ARP entries used everywhere?

5. **Modern Solutions**: How do switches with DAI improve on host-based defenses?

### Lab Exercise Ideas

1. **Timing Analysis**: Modify intervals and observe when attacks succeed/fail

2. **Detection Algorithm**: Implement heuristic to detect ARP spoofing

3. **Network Topology**: Extend to 5+ nodes, multiple attackers

4. **Defense Comparison**: Measure effectiveness of different mitigation strategies

5. **Real-World Mapping**: Map simulation to actual network hardware/software

### Report/Assignment Suggestions

1. Run simulation, take screenshots of each phase
2. Explain ARP protocol operation (with packet format)
3. Describe attack mechanism and MITM threat model
4. Compare defense mechanisms (table of pros/cons)
5. Research production solutions (DAI, port security)
6. Include code snippets showing key functions
