## 🎯 Most Common Tasks

### Task: "I want to see how ARP spoofing works"
**Command**: `python arp_sim.py`  
**Time**: 2 minutes  
**Observe**: Gray → Green → Red line colors  

---

### Task: "I need to present this to my class"
**Read**: DEMO_GUIDE.md "Quick 2-Minute Demo"  
**Practice**: Run demo 3 times  
**Present**: Follow the script  

---

### Task: "I need data for my report"
**Run**: `python arp_sim_extended.py`  
**Enable logging**: Press **'l'**  
**Export data**: Press **'e'**  
**Screenshots**: Capture each phase  

---

### Task: "I don't understand ARP"
**Read**: THEORY.md sections 1-2  
**Watch**: Run simulation while reading  
**Experiment**: Try both defenses (r/s keys)  

---

## 🆘 Help!

### "It won't run!"
→ Check: `python --version` (need 3.7+)  
→ Install: `pip install matplotlib`  
→ Try: `python run_demo.py`  

### "I don't see colors!"
→ Check your terminal/projector settings  
→ Try different matplotlib backend  
→ Read SETUP.md for solutions  

### "What do I watch for?"
→ **Gray line**: No ARP mapping  
→ **Green line**: Correct mapping (safe)  
→ **Red line**: Poisoned cache (attack!)  

### "Where's the documentation?"
→ Quick: QUICKSTART.md  
→ Complete: README.md  
→ Theory: THEORY.md  
→ Demos: DEMO_GUIDE.md
