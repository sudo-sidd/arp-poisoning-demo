## üéØ Q&A Preparation

### Common Questions & Answers

**Q: Is this a real attack?**
- [ ] A: It's a simulation, but the technique is real
- [ ] Used on actual networks by attackers
- [ ] We're demonstrating safely without risk

**Q: Is this legal?**
- [ ] A: This simulation is 100% legal (no real traffic)
- [ ] Real ARP spoofing is illegal without authorization
- [ ] Only for educational purposes

**Q: Can WiFi be attacked this way?**
- [ ] A: Yes! WiFi is just another Layer 2 network
- [ ] Same vulnerability applies
- [ ] Extra reason to avoid untrusted WiFi

**Q: Does HTTPS protect against this?**
- [ ] A: Partially - data is encrypted
- [ ] But attacker still sees metadata
- [ ] Can perform SSL stripping in some cases

**Q: What's the real-world defense?**
- [ ] A: Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) on switches
- [ ] 802.1X network access control
- [ ] HTTPS everywhere
- [ ] Security awareness

**Q: Can you show me how to do this for real?**
- [ ] A: Cannot demonstrate real attacks
- [ ] Against ethical guidelines
- [ ] Could show detection tools (arpwatch)
- [ ] Recommend controlled lab environment
