**Script**:
1. Run `python arp_sim.py`
2. Wait for red line
3. Press 'r' (temporary fix)
4. Press 's' (permanent fix)
5. Explain trade-offs

**Files needed**: `arp_sim.py`, [DEMO_GUIDE.md](./DEMO_GUIDE.md)

**Purpose**: Show advanced defenses

**Script**:
1. Run `python arp_sim_extended.py`
2. Press 'd' to enable detection
3. Watch for alert icon when poisoned
4. Press 'a' to enable auto-defend
5. Observe automatic restoration

**Files needed**: `arp_sim_extended.py`

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

### Change Attack Speed
Edit `arp_sim.py` or `arp_sim_extended.py`, lines 11-13:
```python
ARP_REQUEST_INTERVAL = 3.0    # Seconds between victim requests
SPOOFER_INTERVAL = 2.0        # Seconds between attacks
```

### Change Colors
Edit around line 140:
```python
flow_line.set_color('blue')    # Instead of green
flow_line.set_color('orange')  # Instead of red
```

### Add More Nodes
Copy the node definition pattern:
```python
new_victim = {
    "name": "Victim2",
    "ip": "192.168.1.11",
    "mac": "BB:BB:BB:BB:BB:11",
    "arp": {}
}
```
